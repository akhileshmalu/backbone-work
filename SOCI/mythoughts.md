First of all it was a very good excercise. I had never worked on backbone / underscore.js before.

I would say learning curve was steep initially but now I do have good understaing of basic concepts.

I took aroound 3 days to train my self (daily about 3 hours).

And it took me about 6 hours to complete. (daily 2 hours for 2 days);

I believe any new work in backbone now shall not take this long as I have developed a core uderstanding of this framework.


Thank you for givng this chance and opportunity. I am highly obliged that i got this introduction of backbone.js through this interview process.
